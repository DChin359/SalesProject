# SalesProject

Hello, thank you for visiting. This is my first upload to GitHub. This is from a dataset taken from Kaggle of sales in 2019 for electronics. I used SQL and Tableau for this project. I imported the dataset to SQL and modified the table for more specific information then brought it to Tableau for the visualizations.
