# SalesProject

Hello, thank you for visiting. This is my first upload to GitHub. This is from a dataset taken from Kaggle of sales in 2019 for electronics. I used SQL and Tableau for this project. I imported the dataset to SQL and modified the table for more specific information then brought it to Tableau for the visualizations.

Q: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  - December was the best month for sales at $4.61M worth of products sold. Probably because it is the holiday season so people are buying a lot more for gifts.
  
Q: What was the worse month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  - July was the worse month for sales at $0.43M worth of products sold. Probably because it is the middle of the summer and there are not as many discounts and people are enjoying the outdoors.
  
Q: What state had the highest number of sales?
  - California had the highest number of sales, taking up 39.78% of the total sales.
  
Q: What time should we display adverstisement to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
  - Around 12:00PM afternoon, and 7:00PM were when the most sales happened
 
Q: What time was the worse time for sales?
  - As expected, 2:00AM to 5:00AM were the worse times of sales because everyone is usually asleep.
  
Q: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
  - Batteries, and charging cables were the items that sold the most. A lot of electronics require batteries and multiple items in a household require them so buying a lot of them make sense to have some in reserve. Same case for the charging cables, people like to have multiple cables in a household for easy access.
  
Q:  Which products sold the least? Why do you think so?
  - The dryer and washing machine sold the least. Those items are usually buy one and have it for hopefully a long time so there is no need to buy those items often.
